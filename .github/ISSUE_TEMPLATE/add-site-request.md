Please note, I'm basically the only developer working on WebToEpub, and I'm not paid for doing this.  (WebToEpub is completely free, and generates no money.) By asking to add a site, you're asking me to give you some of my limited free time. So, I think it's not unreasonable for me to ask you to do as much as you can to help me.

### Provide URL for web page that contains Table of Contents (list of chapters) of a typical story on the site

### Did you try using the Default Parser for the site?  If not, why not?
Instructions for using the default parser can be found at https://github.com/dteviot/WebToEpub/wiki/FAQ#how-to-convert-a-new-site-using-the-default-parser

### What settings did you use?  What didn't work?
* URL of first chapter
* CSS selector for element holding content to put into EPUB
* CSS selector for element holding Title of Chapter
* CSS selector for element(s) to remove

### If the Default Parser did not work, if you have developer skills, did you try writing a new parser?
Instructions https://github.com/dteviot/WebToEpub/wiki/FAQ#how-to-write-a-new-parser

### If you don't have developer skills, can you ask a friend who does have them if they can do it for you?

### If you tried writing a parser, and it doesn't work.  Attach the parser here.
